**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** Completed & Production Build Successful

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Profile Picture Upload Implementation

**Added File Upload UI:**
- Added profile picture upload button to profile page (appears when editing)
- Upload button appears as a blue camera icon overlay on profile image
- File input hidden but triggered by clicking the upload button
- Supports image file types (image/*)

**Upload Handler:**
- Validates file size (maximum 5MB)
- Converts image to base64 data URL
- Sends to `/api/profile/upload` endpoint
- Updates profile_image in formData and displays preview immediately
- Shows success/error messages to user

**Backend API:**
- Created `src/app/api/profile/upload/route.ts`
- Accepts POST requests with filename and base64 data
- Validates data URL format
- Saves image to `public/uploads/` directory
- Returns public URL path (`/uploads/filename.ext`)
- Image persists in database via PATCH /api/profile

**Database Storage:**
- Profile image URL saved in `users.profile_image` column
- Persists across sessions
- Image accessible even after years via stored URL path

### 2. Navbar Authentication State Fix

**Problem:**
- Navbar showed "Sign In" and "Sign Up" buttons even when user was logged in
- No way to access user profile or logout from navbar

**Solution Implemented:**

**Desktop Navbar:**
- Added authentication state check using `/api/auth/verify`
- When logged in:
  - Shows user profile picture (or default User icon)
  - Shows user name
  - Notifications bell icon (only when authenticated)
  - Dropdown menu with:
    - Dashboard link
    - My Profile link
    - Logout button (red, with icon)
- When logged out:
  - Shows "Sign In" link
  - Shows "Sign Up" button (green)

**Mobile Navbar:**
- Similar authentication check
- When logged in:
  - Shows user avatar and name at top of mobile menu
  - Shows user type (client/freelancer)
  - Dashboard link
  - My Profile link
  - Logout button
- When logged out:
  - Shows "Sign In" and "Sign Up" buttons

**Features Added:**
- Click outside dropdown to close
- Logout functionality redirects to home page
- Profile image displays in navbar (synced with database)
- Smooth transitions and hover effects

## Testing Results

### Manual Testing:
- **Profile upload:** Uploaded test image, saved successfully to `public/uploads/`
- **Database persistence:** Profile image URL saved to database, loads on page refresh
- **Navbar auth state:** Correctly shows user info when logged in, sign in/up when logged out
- **Dropdown menu:** Opens/closes correctly, all links work
- **Mobile menu:** User info displays correctly, logout works
- **Logout:** Successfully clears session and redirects to home

### Build Testing:
```
npm run build
✓ Compiled successfully in 3.9s
✓ Linting and checking validity of types
✓ Collecting page data
✓ Generating static pages (23/23)
✓ Finalizing page optimization
```

**Build Status:** SUCCESS (all pages compiled, no errors)

## API Endpoints Summary

## Key Features

### Profile Picture Upload:
- Client-side validation (file size, type)
- Base64 encoding for transfer
- Server-side storage in public/uploads/
- Database persistence in users.profile_image
- Immediate preview after upload
- Success/error feedback messages

### Navbar Authentication:
- Real-time auth state detection
- Profile picture display from database
- User dropdown menu (desktop)

## Technical Notes

**Image Storage:**
- Images stored in: `public/uploads/`
- URL format: `/uploads/{timestamp}_{filename}.{ext}`
- Database stores: URL path (not file itself)
- Accessible via static file serving

**Authentication Flow:**
- Navbar checks `/api/auth/verify` on mount
- If authenticated: loads user data + notifications
- If not: shows sign in/up buttons
- Logout calls `/api/auth/logout` and redirects

**State Management:**
- React useState for user, isAuthenticated, showUserMenu
- useEffect for initial auth check
- Conditional rendering based on auth state

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. Add image cropping before upload
2. Add image compression to reduce file size
3. Migrate to cloud storage (S3, Cloudinary) for production
4. Add option to remove profile picture
5. Add profile picture to dashboard and other user-facing areas
6. Add username/email to dropdown menu
