Day 3: Profile Management - Implementation & Test Report

Date: October 17, 2025

Summary:
- Implemented profile pages and APIs
- Added profile edit functionality
- Added profile image upload API and client integration
- Updated database schema to include missing user profile fields
- Tested manually and via server logs; dev server running and APIs returning 200

Files added/modified:
- Added: src/app/api/profile/route.ts (GET/PATCH)
- Added: src/app/api/profile/upload/route.ts (POST)
- Added: src/app/profile/page.tsx (client profile UI + edit + upload)
- Modified: src/app/dashboard/page.tsx (link to profile page)
- Modified: src/lib/database-sqlite.ts (db schema initializer unchanged but migration run)
- Added: scripts/migrate-user-table.ts (migration script)
- Added: scripts/test-profile-apis.js (test script)

Testing performed:
- Started dev server (next dev)
- Verified /api/profile GET returns 200 for authenticated users
- Verified /api/profile PATCH updates profile and returns updated profile
- Verified image upload to /api/profile/upload stores file in public/uploads and returns URL
- Verified profile page loads, displays data, and supports editing and uploading
- Ran production build to confirm compilation; resolved issues with useSearchParams and Suspense; fixed other minor TypeScript issues

Manual checks (via dev server logs):
- Login attempts verified with correct user
- GET /api/profile returned 200
- PATCH /api/profile returned 200
- GET /profile returned 200 and rendered page

Notes / Next steps:
- Add server-side validation for uploaded images (mime type and size)
- Add unit tests for API endpoints
- Consider storing images in an object storage (S3) in production
- Add confirmation modals for sensitive profile changes

Status: Completed and build verified locally.
